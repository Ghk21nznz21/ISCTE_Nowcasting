# ISCTE_Nowcasting
My final project at ISCTE.
My group were asked by Instituto Nacional de Estatistica to develope a Nowcasting Model for the Unemployment Rate.

Description:

      * The project was made using python, jupyter notebook and R

      We first started to read multiple previous studies made on this topic or simmiliar ones.
      Based on what we found and the small size of Unemployment Rate data, we decided to use variables from Google Trends.
      
      We then processed to clean and analyse that data, generating some interesting graphs (present in the presentation powerpoint).
      This included the usage of time series hypothesis tests
      
      Finally we developed our main model Dynamic Factor, and compared it to an Vectorial Auto Regressive model and an Auto Regressive model.
