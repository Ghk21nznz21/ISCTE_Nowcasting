# ISCTE_Nowcasting
My final project at ISCTE.
My group was asked by Instituto Nacional de Estatistica to develop a Nowcasting Model for the Unemployment Rate.

Description:

      * The project was made using python, jupyter notebook, and R

      We first read multiple previous studies made on this topic or similar ones. Based on what we found and the small size of the Unemployment Rate data, we decided to use variables from Google Trends.
      
      We then proceed to clean (this also included time series hypothesis tests) and analyze that data, generating some interesting graphs (present in the presentation PowerPoint).
      
      Finally, we developed a Dynamic Factor Model and compared it to a Vectorial Auto-Regressive and an Auto-Regressive model.
